# ka

challenge framework

# using:
  *acorn
  *ace

# why acorn?
  *While Esprima seems to have robust documentation, even via http://esprima.org/test/compare.html it seems that Acorn is faster than Esprima

# why ace?
  *ace works on IE which CodeMirror doesn't seem to support. Cross browser functionality was a big consideration.

# how to run:
  *download repo
  *copy path of index.html
  *paste it into browser
  *voila!
